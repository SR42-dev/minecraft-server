# minecraft-server
A modular package to automate server hosting and backup on a local machine based on papermc.
Compatible with Ubuntu 20.04. Not supported on Windows.
Runs an instance of Minecraft 1.19.

Cloning this repository will give you a copy of SR42's server but pushing back won't be allowed unless you are a member of this server.
Collaboration requests will only be approved for Food Club members and trusted friends of the community.

The 'run' executable should have its permissions changed before use. 
The same executable will update, run and backup the world in that order if executed by a collaborator of this repository.
